# Database
The database for this project is being hosted with Render which is a service that allows you to host Postgres databases on a free account. I came across the service as part of the Codecademy curriculum, you can set up your own db instance by following the instuctions [here](https://www.codecademy.com/journeys/back-end-engineer/paths/becj-22-advanced-back-end-development/tracks/becj-22-deploying-a-server/modules/becj-23-deploying-back-ends-with-render/articles/creating-a-postgresql-database-with-render)

For a visual representation of the database see [personal-budget.pdf](./personal-budget.pdf). 

When you have set up your db instance you can run the [personal-budget.sql](./personal-budget.sql) script to create the table within the db.
