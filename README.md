![GitHub top language](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/lukewelden/personal-budget)
Hey there, fellow developers and budgeting enthusiasts! Welcome to the exciting world of personal budget management brought to you by the Personal Budget API. Get ready to take control of your finances and build a seamless budgeting experience using this powerful API.

## üöÄ Project Intro
In this project, I'll be crafting a robust API that empowers you to efficiently manage your personal budget using the principles of Envelope Budgeting. With this API, you'll have the freedom to create, customize, and closely monitor your budget envelopes, all while staying on top of your financial game.

## üì¶ What Can You Expect?
This API isn't just about numbers and endpoints; it's about taking charge of your financial well-being. Here's what you can look forward to:

- **Node.js and Express Awesomeness:** I'm diving into the world of Node.js and Express to create a dynamic API that's both efficient and user-friendly.

- **Envelope CRUD Operations:** Want to create, read, update, or delete an envelope? You've got it! With intuitive API endpoints, you can manage your envelopes effortlessly.

- **Balance Tracking Made Easy:** Ever wondered how much is left in your "Eating Out" envelope? The API has your back. Easily update and track envelope balances.

- **Clean RESTful Design:** I believe in clean code and clean APIs. That's why I'm sticking to the best practices for RESTful design, ensuring that everything makes sense and flows seamlessly.

- **Git and Collaboration:** Keeping track of code changes is a breeze with Git version control. Plus, collaborating with others becomes a piece of cake.

- **Testing with Postman:** Before you ask, yes, I'll be extensively testing the API endpoints using Postman. It's all about delivering a robust and bug-free experience.

## üîß Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Familiarity with command line usage and file navigation.
- Proficiency in JavaScript programming.
- Understanding of Node.js and its ecosystem.
- Knowledge of the Express framework for building web applications.
- Experience with Git for version control and GitHub for collaborative development.
- Basic understanding of API testing using Postman.


## ü§ù Getting Started
If you're as excited as I am (and I know you are), here's what you can do to get started:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Get your hands on the code by cloning the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/personal-budget-api.git

2. **Navigate and Install:** Hop into the project directory and install the necessary dependencies: cd personal-budget-api && npm install

3. **Start Building:** Fire up the development server and start building your budgeting masterpiece: npm start

## üåê API Endpoints
- `GET /envelopes`: Retrieve a list of all budget envelopes.
- `GET /envelopes/:id`: Retrieve details of a specific envelope by its ID.
- `POST /envelopes`: Create a new budget envelope.
- `PUT /envelopes/:id`: Update the details of a specific envelope.
- `DELETE /envelopes/:id`: Delete a budget envelope.
  Additionally, there will be endpoints for managing envelope balances.

## üë∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Testing
Use Postman to test and interact with the API endpoints. You can import the provided Postman collection to get started quickly.

## üî• Join the Budgeting Adventure
I invite you to embark on this budgeting adventure with me. As I dive into Node.js, Express, Git, and more, you'll witness the creation of an API that's not just lines of code, but a tool that can truly transform how we manage our finances.

Stay curious, keep coding, and let's make budgeting a breeze together!
